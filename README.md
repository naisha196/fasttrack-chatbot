## FastTrack Punjab Chatbot 

This is a chatbot built for the FastTrack Punjab portal, the single-window system where businesses in Punjab apply for approvals, clearances, and NOCs.
The chatbot helps users understand approval processes, document requirements, and application stages without having to search through multiple pages or PDFs.
Users can ask questions in their own language and get clear, direct answers related to the portal.

The FastTrack Punjab portal combines approvals from many departments, which can be confusing for users.
This chatbot makes the process easier to understand by acting as a simple guide inside the portal.
